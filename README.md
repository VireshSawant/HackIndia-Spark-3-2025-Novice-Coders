About This Project
This project is an AI-powered assistant designed to make document search and retrieval effortless. By combining state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models with a user-friendly web interface, our assistant helps you quickly locate and highlight key information within your documents. With features like semantic search, AI-driven summarization, and context-aware snippet extraction, you can say goodbye to endless scrolling and manual searching.

Key Features
Smart Document Processing:
Automatically extracts text from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files and breaks it down into manageable chunks for analysis.

Semantic Search:
Leverages advanced embedding models to understand the meaning behind your search queries, ensuring you get the most relevant results.

Context-Aware Snippets:
Uses a question-answering model to pull out exactly the information you’re looking for, highlighting the key points in the results.

AI Summarization:
Generates concise and meaningful summaries using powerful NLP models, saving you time and effort.

User Personalization:
Remembers your search history and preferences, helping you refine your results over time.

Data Visualization:
Visualizes document statistics with interactive charts and graphs, making it easy to understand your document collection at a glance.

Easy-to-Use Interface:
Built with Streamlit and Flask for a responsive and intuitive web experience.

Getting Started
Installation
Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/ai-document-search.git](https://github.com/VireshSawant/HackIndia-Spark-3-2025-Novice-Coders)
cd ai-document-search

Set Up a Virtual Environment:

Create and activate a virtual environment (this step helps keep your project dependencies isolated):

Windows:
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate


macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate

Install the Required Dependencies:
With your virtual environment activated, install everything by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare the Necessary Folders:
Ensure that the following directories exist in your project folder:

uploads
document_storage
vector_index
user_data

On Windows, you can create these folders manually or run the following commands one by one:

mkdir uploads
mkdir document_storage
mkdir vector_index
mkdir user_data

Running the App
For the Frontend (Streamlit):

Start the Streamlit application with:
streamlit run your_app_file.py
(Replace your_app_file.py with the actual filename of your Streamlit app.)


How It Works
The AI Assistant uses several smart techniques to deliver fast and accurate search results:

Document Processing:
Documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) are processed and split into small, overlapping chunks, preserving context for later analysis.

Semantic Search:
Each chunk is converted into an embedding using a deep learning model. When you search, your query is also converted into an embedding, and the assistant finds the most similar document chunks.

QA-Based Snippet Extraction:
For the best matching chunks, a question-answering model extracts the most relevant snippet that directly answers your query. These snippets are highlighted to help you see why a result is relevant.

Summarization:
The assistant can also generate summaries of documents using state-of-the-art summarization models, so you can quickly understand the overall content.

User Personalization & Visualization:
Your search history and preferences are saved, and the app offers dynamic visualizations to give you insights into your document collection.
